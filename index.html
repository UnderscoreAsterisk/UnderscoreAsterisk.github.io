    <h1>Welcome to my blog</h1>
    <article>
    <p>Here, I post insights related to various domains of Computer Science. 
        These posts are intended to act as reference, either for me from 
        the future or for strangers on the internet who may stumble across this blog.
        This may also act as a portfolio for potential employers, I haven't really decided yet.</p>
